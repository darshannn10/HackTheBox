# Linux Boxes

This Writeups consists of boxes/machines i've solved while preparing for OSCP. I'm solving these boxes according to the list specified by [T J NULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#).

Along with them, I'll also solve few other boxes that'll help me in getting better while preparing for OSCP
